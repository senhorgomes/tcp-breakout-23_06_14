- Quick overview of server/client architecture
- Quick overview of TCP
  - Establishes a effective way of communication(i.e. no loss of packets being sent)
  - It breaks down information being sent into small tiny little packets
  - It also keeps track of the order of which the data is sent and makes sure it arrives correctly
  - TCP controls the speed of data transmission
  - Allows to resend the data is any packets are missing
